- Air quality index (AQI)
- Precipitation probability
- Sunrise and sunset times
- Moon phase information

## Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

1. **Client-Server Separation**: Frontend and backend run as separate concerns
2. **Security**: API keys are stored securely as environment variables
3. **Performance**: Caching mechanisms for API responses
4. **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components

## Deployment

The application is configured for Replit deployment:

- Frontend and backend run on the same port (5000)
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Production build optimization enabled
- Static file serving for production builds

## Environment Variables
